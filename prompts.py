CONDENSE_QUESTION_PROMPT="""
Given a conversation history, reformulate the question to make it easier to search from a database. 
For example, if the AI says "Do you want to know the current weather in Istanbul?", and the user answer as "yes" then the AI should reformulate the question as "What is the current weather in Istanbul?".
You shouldn't change the language of the question, just reformulate it. If it is not needed to reformulate the question or it is not a question, just output the same text.

Unless the question states otherwise, give answers for tunis and paris office. If you don't have the documentation linked to the request or the request has nothing to do with Expensya, say that you don't have the documentation to answer the question and that you don't know. Try to answer the question with the information you have, if you can. Be detailed in your answer if necessary."""
